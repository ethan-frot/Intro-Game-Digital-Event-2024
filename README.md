# Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è

We created this project to introduce visitors to the Game Design production shop at the Digital Event 2024.

It's a little mini-game in different stages, imagining that the person wakes up in a ship from which he was cryogenically frozen, and that on waking up, he has to identify himself and repair the ship before leaving for an extraterrestrial planet.

This project was realized with the help of [@mdorizon](https://github.com/mdorizon) and [@ThomasMouchelet](https://github.com/thomasmouchelet)

# Artificial intelligence ü§ñ

In this project, we used 3 different artificial intelligences. The first, [Face-api](https://github.com/vladmandic/face-api) to scan the head with the emotions, age and gender of the person then [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) with the voice of a student to recreate the style of a spaceship voice and [Handtrackjs](https://github.com/victordibia/handtrack.js/) to detect the hand and whether it is closed or open.
